The idea is that it will always reflect kotlin’s <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html\">official code style</a> so the idea here is to be a cosmetic static analysis tool.\n<code class=\"language-text\">Detekt</code> on the other hand provides many other features like complexity reports, code smell analysis while also being extensively configurable.</p>\n<h1>Basic integration pitfalls</h1>\n<p>Both tools provide many ways to integrate in your project. You can add a plain gradle task, a gradle plugin or install the command line interface. The recommended route is via a gradle plugin.\nAfter integrating these tools in your project you can use tasks like <code class=\"language-text\">detektCheck</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ktlintCheck</code> to run over all your project and report the issues. And that’s it, you’re done!</p>\n<h5>Yes, but also no.</h5>\n<p>The problem with the basic integration is that in real life things tend to be a little different.\nIf you’re adding static analysis to a greenfield project, it’s usually fine to run those tasks over the whole project, but if that is not your case, you’ll probably want to avoid auto-formatting your whole project or getting 5k+ warnings every time you run one of those tasks. Warnings just turn into noise.\nYou could use a <em>baseline</em>, which is a configuration that helps incremental adoption on a project, but you’re still going to stumble in some issues related to running these over your whole codebase.</p>\n<h2>A better solution</h2>\n<p>If you stop and think about it to be able to get the benefits I’ve mentioned in the beginning of this post, ideally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want these tasks to run fast, so you can run them often.</li>\n<li>You want to incrementally adopt this in your codebase</li>\n<li>And last, but certainly not least: you don’t want to keep forgetting to run these tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Configuring both tools is really similar, so I’ll highlight some points that happen in both scripts. You can get detekt’s <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/iurysza/005c08ff7f1892097c2823b1786ac087\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>So, the magic here is to get the files that were changed in our commit</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s git command that does just that:\n<code class=\"language-text\">$ git diff --name-only origin/main --relative</code> In line 38 we call it by using groovy’s api. This will output all the change files names.</li>\n<li>In line 44 we process the output so that we can pass the filename list to ktlint/detekt.</li>\n<li>From lines 13 to 20 we decide whether we need to run static analysis or just ignore all files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>{% gist <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/iurysza/dada9047da83d101a6c4b63ed8407cb3\">https://gist.github.com/iurysza/dada9047da83d101a6c4b63ed8407cb3</a> %}</p>\n<p>And that’s about it! The rest of the code (from both scripts) just handles the report output location.</p>\n<h4>Good! Almost there now!</h4>\n<p>We just need a way to make this a part of our workflow. This way we won’t forget to run these tasks. And yeah, we can use a <code class=\"language-text\">git-hook</code> like the <code class=\"language-text\">pre-commit</code> hook to do just that.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar with git-hooks, you can check them <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks\">here</a>, but if you want to keep reading, just think about them as a piece of code that is going to be called when you do something in git.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">pre-commit</code> hook will run when you try to commit something. It runs before git actually creates the commit, so the idea is to only allow a new commit when our static analysis passes successfully, effectively creating our first quality gate. Woot woot!</p>\n<p>{% gist <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/iurysza/fc6d0b735089c573aa5b0ce8797ef548\">https://gist.github.com/iurysza/fc6d0b735089c573aa5b0ce8797ef548</a> %}</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/IwAZ6dvvvaTtdI8SD5/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>That’s it! This makes sure that every piece of code you commit has to follow the minimum quality standards that you and your team agreed upon.\nThis is not yet a <em>final solution</em> as people can bypass those checks by running <code class=\"language-text\">git commit --no-verify</code>, but it’s a solid first step towards a better codebase.</p>\n<p>Besides, if you think about it, these scripts can be easily integrated to a CI environment.
